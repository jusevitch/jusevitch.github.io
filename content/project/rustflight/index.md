ROSFlight is a lean, open-source autopilot system built by researchers, for researchers. ROSFlight was originally developed by James Jackson, Daniel Koch, and Tim McLain, and is still being developed and improved by members of the MAGICC Lab.

Our current work on ROSFlight focuses on increasing the safety of modern autopilots through both memory-safe programming languages and online control theoretic techniques.
