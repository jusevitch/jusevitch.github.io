#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I joined the BYU Electrical and Computer Engineering department as an Assistant Professor in 2023. My work focuses on developing safe, intelligent, robust, and resilient multi-agent robotic and autonomous systems. Areas of particular interest include designing algorithms that allow for teams of autonomous robots or agents to safely operate despite the presence of faults or adversarial attacks, and uniting classical and machine learning algorithms through differentiable programming and scientific machine learning.
